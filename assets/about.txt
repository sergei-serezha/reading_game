Kids’ media has become a sensory arms race: ultra-sharp visuals, saturated colors, loud sound effects, and scene cuts that come every few seconds. That kind of “always-on” stimulation can hijack attention and leave fewer mental resources for the thing you actually want a child to do—hold instructions in mind, practice a skill, and self-correct. In research with preschoolers, even a short dose (minutes) of fast-paced, highly fantastical TV has been shown to temporarily worsen executive function—skills like working memory, self-control, and flexible thinking that sit at the core of learning.  ￼

That’s why I built this as a deliberately low-noise experience: fewer pixels, calmer visuals, gentler audio, and slower transitions—so the brain spends less effort “parsing the show” and more effort practicing the lesson. It’s the “slow is fast” idea applied to learning: reduce distractions, lower cognitive load, and you get better focus, stronger retention, and more consistent progress. Instead of explosions and rapid cuts, you’ll see simple shapes, clear prompts, and enough breathing room for kids to think—because the goal isn’t to compete for attention; it’s to earn understanding.

When I was little, I pronounced letters the way they sounded. It made perfect sense to me. A letter wasn’t a name — it was a sound.

One day my dad took me to an eye doctor. She pointed at letters on a chart and asked me to read them. I pronounced them phonetically, the way they actually sound. She looked at me strangely. I didn’t understand why.

Later that day, my dad was disappointed that I didn’t know the “names” of the letters. By midnight, I had memorized them all.

It wasn’t difficult. I learned them quickly.

But I didn’t understand why I had to.

Without realizing it, I learned the wrong lesson: that reading is about memorizing labels instead of hearing and blending sounds.

Years later, when I moved to the United States and had to learn a new language, I made the same mistake again. I focused on letter names instead of letter sounds. Even now, I can tell you — that early confusion still echoes.

That experience stayed with me.

So when I saw my nephew beginning to learn letters, I started thinking:
What if we made it easier?
What if we taught reading the way it actually works — through sound?
What if we removed the noise and let children focus on what truly matters?

This game is my attempt to fix the lesson I misunderstood.

Not by rejecting letter names — but by putting sound first.

Because reading isn’t about memorizing symbols.

Add my story:
When I was little I called the latters phonetically just like they sound. It made sense to me. One day my dad took me to the eye doctor, and she was pointing at letters to check my eyes , and I would pronounce letters as they sound . She looked at me funny and I didn’t related that at the time. Later my dad was very disappointed that I didn’t know the names of all letters and made me learn it by midnight that day.
I learned it - it wasn’t a big deal. But  I didn’t get why?
I learned the wrong lesson then and when I came to US and had to learn a new language . I focused on learning the letter pronouncian and not its sound. I can tell you it’s still a problem for me.
So I thought about making it easier for my neohiew to learn to read faster so that he can enjoy the written word!

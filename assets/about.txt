My story:

When I was little, I said letters the way they sounded. I never thought it was wrong. You hear the sound and you pronounce it. It was natural to me.

One day my dad took me to an eye doctor. The doctor pointed at the chart and asked me to read the letters. I read them phonetically, the way they actually sound. She paused and looked at me strangely. I only realized it after the fact.

That evening my dad was upset that I didn’t know the “names” of the letters. By midnight, I had learned them all.

It wasn’t hard. I memorized them quickly.
What stayed with me wasn’t the difficulty. It was the confusion. 

Why did the name matter more than the sound?

I didn’t think about it much after that time and always prioritized names over sounds. 
Years later, when I moved to the United States and had to learn English. I made a mistake and focused on letter names instead of sounds. I treated reading like memorization instead of listening. Even now, I can feel how that early wiring shaped the way I approached English.

I never really thought about it again until I had my own kids. I made sure to explain the importance of both but optimized on sounds over names.

Now, my nephew started learning his letters, I watched closely. I kept thinking about that doctor’s office. About midnight memorization. About learning something correctly, but for the wrong reason.

I want reading to feel intuitive for him. Reading isn’t about reciting symbols in order. It’s about hearing meaning take shape and learning names first is really an obstacle for reading.

This game began as a small idea to make it easier for him to connect letters to the sounds.

If he can reach the joy of reading faster than I did, then this project will be a success.

-I hope you enjoy the game! Uncle Serge

For Adults:

Kids’ media has become a sensory arms race: ultra-sharp visuals, saturated colors, loud sound effects, and scene cuts that come every few seconds. That kind of “always-on” stimulation can hijack attention and leave fewer mental resources for the thing you actually want a child to do—hold instructions in mind, practice a skill, and self-correct. In research with preschoolers, even a short dose (minutes) of fast-paced, highly fantastical TV has been shown to temporarily worsen executive function—skills like working memory, self-control, and flexible thinking that sit at the core of learning.  ￼

That’s why I built this as a deliberately low-noise experience: fewer pixels, calmer visuals, gentler audio, and slower transitions—so the brain spends less effort “parsing the show” and more effort practicing the lesson. It’s the “slow is fast” idea applied to learning: reduce distractions, lower cognitive load, and you get better focus, stronger retention, and more consistent progress. Instead of explosions and rapid cuts, you’ll see simple shapes, clear prompts, and enough breathing room for kids to think—because the goal isn’t to compete for attention; it’s to earn understanding.
